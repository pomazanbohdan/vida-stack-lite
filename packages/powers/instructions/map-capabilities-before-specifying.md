# Map capabilities before specifying

## Phase 0: Scope Check

Most requests describe one capability. If this one does, skip this phase and go straight to Specify — Phase 0 exists for the exception, not the rule, and it puts no hierarchy on single-capability features.

**Detection.** Decompose before specifying when a single requirement bundles several independently testable capabilities:

- The requirement names distinct capabilities with their own consumers or data (e.g. identity, billing, notifications, reporting)
- Acceptance criteria cluster into groups that could ship and be verified separately
- One capability could be cut or replaced without rewriting the others' requirements

**Propose a capability map before writing any spec.** Small and reviewable — a module table plus a build order, not a project plan:

```markdown
# Capability Map: [Initiative Name]

| Module id | Responsibility | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| identity | Accounts, sessions, SSO | — |
| billing | Plans, invoices, payments | identity |
| notifications | Email and webhook fan-out | identity |
| reporting | Usage dashboards | billing, notifications |

Build order: identity → billing, notifications → reporting
```

- **Stable module ids.** Kebab-case, chosen once, never renamed mid-initiative. Specs, plans, and downstream commands select work by these ids instead of guessing which spec is active.
- **Dependency direction, no cycles.** Arrows point one way. If two modules each need the other, they are one module.
- **Interfaces live at the boundary.** The map records that `billing` depends on `identity`; the contract between them belongs in the provider module's spec.

**The map is gated like every phase.** The human reviews module boundaries, dependency direction, and build order before any module spec is written. Getting the map wrong is expensive; reviewing ten lines is not.

**Then recurse per module.** Run Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement for each module in dependency order. Each module gets its own spec, scoped to that module's objective, boundaries, and success criteria. Save the approved map at the project root and each module's spec alongside it, named by module id (`SPEC-identity.md`, `SPEC-billing.md`) — the map, not filename guessing, is the index of what exists.

## Red Flags

- One spec whose requirements span several independently testable capabilities
- Module boundaries or build order decided implicitly during implementation because no capability map was approved up front
